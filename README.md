# factstree
Display gathered ansible facts in an interactive tree

## This is a simple script which gathers ansible facts from a host and uses the jtree python module to display them in an interactive window

### Copy this script to your system, make it executeable, and optionally pass a hostname if you wish to gather facts from a host other than localhost
***NOTE:* If you are not in a location that is configured to use your ansible inventory file, this will fail**
